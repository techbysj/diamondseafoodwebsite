        Our primary focus revolves around catching Live Deep-sea Crabs. It has
        been a fascinating journey exploring the intricacies of these
        crustaceans to improve their quality. These Crabs are harvested from
        depths ranging between 400 and 800 meters, where they thrive in an
        unspoiled environment characterized by temperatures below 6Â°C. After
        capture, the Crabs are carefully handled with meticulous attention until
        they reach their export destination, ensuring they remain alive and
        strong throughout the entire process.
